# ewp-wp2-use-cases

This file describes the Use-Cases as agreed upon by the consortium at the Technical Workshop in Brussels, 21 & 22 March 2016

The following Use-Cases have been identified

1. Interinstitutional Agreement UC
2. Nominations UC
3. Learning Agreement UC
4. Arrival & Departure UC
5. Transcript of Records UC
6. Grade Conversion UC

## 1. Interinstitutional Agreement UC

The Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA) can be divided into two different sets of data.
1.	Agreement Data
2.	Fact Sheet Data
As Fact Sheets are updated regularly without needing to re-sign the IA, the process can happen independent from the set-up of the IIA.

### Establishment of Interinstitutional Agreement
The process is initiated by Institution1 sending an IIA proposal to Institution2. Institution2 can accept the proposal, which should lead to a notification to Institution1, that the proposal has been agreed upon.
In case Institution2 does not want to establish an IIA with Institution1, they can simply decline the proposal. A possibility to automatically decline all further proposals from Institution1 might be considered.
Institution2 has the possibility to propose changes to the initial proposal, which need to be accepted by Institution1. Should Institution accept the proposed changes, the IIA is final and Institution2 receives a notification.
In case Institution1 does not agree to the changes, they could either initiate a new IIA proposal or simply inform the Institution2 that they do not accept the proposed changes. Institution2 can in that case send a new proposal for changes to the initial IIA proposal.

### Fact Sheets
The Fact Sheets should be updateable at any time as long as an Interinstitutional Agreement has been established. For this reason, both Institution1 and Institution2 can at any time send fact sheet information to the other institution.

## 2. Nominations UC

The Nominations are a rather simple use case and initiate a possible “mobility”.

The sending institution sends a nomination proposal and the receiving institution can either accept or reject the nomination proposal. Accepted nomination proposals become nominees. The receiving institution needs to confirm the nomination.

## 3. Learning Agreement UC

The Learning Agreement process is divided into two parts
1.	Learning Agreement
2.	Learning Agreement changes

The **Learning Agreement** is established by **either** the Sending or the Receiving Institution sending a Learning Agreement proposal to the other institution. The other institution can either accept or reject the Learning Agreement proposal.
In case the Learning Agreement proposal is accepted, it becomes the Learning Agreement and the other institution is notified about it.

**Learning Agreement changes** are proposed by either of the two institutions. The other institution can either accept the changes or refuse them.
In case the Learning agreement changes proposal is accepted, it becomes the Learning Agreement changes and the other institution is notified about it.

**Nota Bene:**
The consortium decided that the implementation of course selection and course catalogues is not part of the current design of EWP. Therefore, the Learning Agreement will be handled as a single entity document

## 4. Arrival & Departure UC
The Arrival and Departure Information are sent by the Receiving Institution to the Sending Institution. The data flow is very simple and does not require for the data to be confirmed.

## 5. Transcript of Records UC
The Transcript of Records (ToR) is being transferred from the Receiving Institution to the Sending Institution. 

Optionally, the Sending Institution can send the Home ToR back to the Receiving Institution.

## 6. Grade Conversion UC

The grade conversion information will be transferred from the Receiving Institution to the Sending Institution.
